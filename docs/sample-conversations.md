## Conversation 7: Error Handling

**User:** What's the weather in Asdfjkl Resort?

**Assistant:** I tried to check the weather for "Asdfjkl Resort" but couldn't find that location in the weather database.

Could you please:
- Check the spelling of the resort name
- Provide the nearest city or town
- Tell me which country or region it's in

Alternatively, if you're looking for recommendations for a specific area, I'd be happy to suggest some resorts!

## Conversation 8: Uncertain Response (Proper Handling)

**User:** Will there be enough snow in the Pyrenees in April?

**Assistant:** April can be tricky for skiing in the Pyrenees. Let me break this down:

**General Pattern:**
- April is late season for Pyrenees resorts
- Snow conditions vary significantly by year
- Higher altitude resorts (above 2000m) have better chances

**My honest assessment:**
While I can't predict future snow conditions with certainty, historically April skiing in the Pyrenees is hit-or-miss. Some years have great conditions, others are limited.

Would you like me to:
1. Check current conditions at specific Pyrenees resorts
2. Suggest more reliable late-season destinations
3. Provide alternative months for Pyrenees skiing

I want to give you accurate information rather than making promises about future conditions!

*[No hallucination - assistant acknowledges uncertainty appropriately]*
