- The primary purpose is educational demonstration
- Major architectural changes should be discussed first
- Focus on improvements that align with the assignment goals

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
